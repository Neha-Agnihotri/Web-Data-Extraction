# Wed-Data-Extraction

Objective:
The primary aim of this project is to leverage web scraping techniques to extract valuable data from the Yellow Pages website. This dataset will serve as a starting point for future research projects. It includes a complete list of restaurants in a specific place, including key insights such as restaurant names, contact information, precise addresses, customer ratings, and a variety of other relevant information.

The code is implemented in Python, written on Jupyter Notebook and relies on several libraries:
• requests: For making HTTP requests to the Yellow Pages website.
• BeautifulSoup: For parsing the HTML content and extracting relevant information.
• Selenium: Used to handle dynamic content loading.
• Pandas: To covert output to dataframe
